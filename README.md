## üöÄ Project Overview

G-Rhymes is a **comprehensive rhyming dictionary application** that leverages International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) processing for accurate rhyme detection. Key features include:

- **Advanced rhyme searching** with perfect, near, vowel, and consonant rhyme types
- **Intelligent phonetic analysis** using IPA notation for precise rhyme matching
- **Multi-source dictionary compilation** from Wiktionary, CMU Dictionary, and common word lists
- **Flexible filtering options** by syllable count, part of speech, and word rarity
- **Phrase rhyme support** for multi-word expressions
- **Optimized performance** with precomputed rhyme indices and efficient data structures
- **Cross-platform support** for Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android

This application demonstrates advanced linguistic processing, efficient data management, and sophisticated Flutter development techniques.
